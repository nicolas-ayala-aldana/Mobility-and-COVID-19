# Mobility-and-COVID-19

**Introduction:** The COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact. Knowing the variables that affect the increase in infection is important for public health decision-making. Mobility and socio-demographic conditions of the population are important factors in the transmission of the virus. The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between mobility, social determinants of health and cases of COVID-19 by random forest method. **Methods:** The COVID-19 cases were analized in the Maule Region, Chile. Spearman rank analysis was performed to analyse Total Mobility Index for each municipality. Random Forest regression was used to create a model between COVID-19 infections, mobility index and sociodemographic variables. P-value <0.05 was considered statistics signinicative response. **Results:** Total mobility was highly correlated with new COVID-19 cases adjusted for total population in each municipality (𝝆: 0.52-0.92). An upward trend is observed for the 30 municipalities analysed. For random forest model, active cases, total mobility and external mobility are obtained as VIM. The most relevant demographic variables were overcrowding, density and area of municipality. The RSquared was 0.68 for the RF model. **Conclusions:** Artificial Intelligence methodologies are increasingly used for their high performance. Random Forest Regression offers a clear solution for the design of predictor variables on the number of new cases per week. Mobility is a powerful predictor variable for the number of new cases.
